# 0x09. Island Perimeter

Island Perimeter Calculator

This Python script calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a grid. The grid consists of cells, where:

- `0` represents water
- `1` represents land

Each cell is square and connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is only one island (or nothing). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water surrounding the island).
